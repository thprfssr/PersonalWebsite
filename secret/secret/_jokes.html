<h3>The Death of a Communist</h3>
<p>A communist died, and since he was an honest man, albeit an atheist, he was
sentenced to rotate spending one year in Hell and one year in Heaven. He went
to Hell first.</p>
<p>One year passed, and Satan said to God, "Take this man as fast as possible.
He turned all my young demons into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin_All-Union_Pioneer_Organization">Young Pioneers</a>!
I have to restore some order." So God takes him into Heaven.</p>
<p>Another year passed, and Satan meets God again, and tells him, "Lord God,
it's my turn now." God replied, "First of all, don't call me Lord God, but
instead, comrade God. Second of all, there is no God. And one more thing, don't
interrupt me or I'll be late to a party meeting."</p>
