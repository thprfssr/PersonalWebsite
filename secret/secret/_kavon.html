<h1>Kavon</h1>


<img src="img/kavon.jpg" id="kavon" style="max-width: 50%" align="right">

<p>Kavon is a sociopathic black man from the Bahamas. His dad is a drug lord who
helped overthrow the government back at home, and now controls about 73% of the
territory in the islands. Kavon is known to always yell "Greetings!" whenever
he walks into a room, so now everybody is copying him. Kavon especially loves
making tea and cafecito for his friends, even if they are mean to him.</p>

<p>Kavon is very sensitive whenever someone dares to call him fat,
even going so far as to smashing the offender against the wall, as happened with
that little girl one time.  Often times, his sociopathy slips right out of him,
making him say stupid things. He tries to cover up what he says by claiming that
a quote from him was taken out of context, but we all know there's no possible
context in which it is justifiable to say these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some people get sexually aroused by smashing little girls against the
      wall.</li>
</ul>
