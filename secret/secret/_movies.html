<h1>Watch a movie from my website</h1>

<p>I have a couple of movies on disk, and I'm generous enough to allow my
friends to stream them from my website for free. In order to do so,
<a href="ftp://danetiska.com/media/movies">click here</a>,
and you'll be taken to a list of the movies that I have on my
server. Then, copy the link of the movie that you wanna watch, and paste it
on your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player">VLC Media Player</a>.
You can now enjoy my free streaming service ;)</p>
