<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Javier, and this is my magnificent website. I absolutely love math,
physics, and linguistics, so you'll find here all sorts of fun projects. Feel
free to scour around and see where all the links take you.</p>

<p>One of my many hobbies is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">conlanging</a>,
which is the art of constructing languages. Recently, I've been working on a
conlang derived from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language">Proto-Indo-European</a>.
At this point, its grammar is complete enough to be able to translate pretty
much anything; the only thing that's left is to fill out the vocabulary list.
The way to do that is to translate as much content as possible into the conlang.</p>

<p>Another one of my hobbies is to work out fun math and physics problems. Over
these past months, I've compiled a short
<a href="?page=fun-problems">list</a> of a dozen or so problems which were
especially satisfying to solve. All my friends know about that list, since I
make them work out some of the problems from time to time :)</p>

<p>I also like coding. A friend and I managed to begin write the very bare
basics of a game engine. More recently, we've
been trying to figure out how to sum up every prime under one trillion. We
successfully found the sum of every prime under 200G in about three days, but
we're trying to make it faster, and to take up less memory. When we're
satisfied with the program, I'll publish the code (and the results, of course).</p>
