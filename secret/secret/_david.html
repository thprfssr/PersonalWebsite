<h1>David</h1>

<p>In the few months that I've known him, I feel privileged to have him in my
circle of friends. David is a wonderful human being who has an intense passion
for mathematics and physics due to an insatiable curiosity for how the Universe
works. And once his curiosity latches on to one of the Universe's many
mysteries, he never rests; he works tirelessly to understand the underlying
principles and their applications.</p>

<p>David is the type of person who gets along with everyone (or almost everyone,
at the very least). The people around him always seem joyful, with a genuine
smile on their face. Moreover, David is a good-hearted person who will help
those he sees in need. If any of his friends needs help with a particular topic,
they simply say, "We need David."</p>

<p>In all of this, I admire him, and I'm proud to call him my friend. Happy 21st
birthday <3</p>
